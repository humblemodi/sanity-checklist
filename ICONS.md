# Extension Icons

## Required Icons

The Sanity Checklist extension requires icon files to be added to an `icons/` folder in the root directory.

### Icon Specifications

The following icon sizes are needed (as specified in manifest.json):

- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels  
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels

### Icon Design Guidelines

- **Style**: Minimalist, clean design matching the Notion-inspired aesthetic
- **Colors**: Consider using simple geometric shapes with a checklist/tasks theme
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Content**: Should represent checklists, tasks, or sanity/mental clarity themes

### Creating the icons/ Folder

1. Create a folder named `icons` in the root directory
2. Add the three required PNG files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png)
3. Ensure icons are optimized for web (small file sizes)

### Temporary Workaround

Until custom icons are created, you can:
- Use placeholder icons from free icon libraries
- Generate simple icons using online tools like [Figma](https://figma.com) or [Canva](https://canva.com)
- Use Chrome's default extension icon (extension will still function without custom icons)

## Note

⚠️ **Current Status**: The icons folder is not yet created. The extension will use Chrome's default icon until proper icons are added.
